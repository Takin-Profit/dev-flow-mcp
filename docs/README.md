# DevFlow MCP Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17

This folder contains essential documentation for DevFlow MCP after the SQLite-only migration.

---

## üìÑ Current Documentation

### [MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md](./MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md) ‚úÖ **START HERE**
Complete record of the SQLite-only migration including:
- What was accomplished (architecture simplification, code removal)
- Final architecture (SQLite-only, no abstractions)
- Code metrics (~6,500 lines removed)
- Remaining work (testing, documentation)

**Read this first** to understand the current state of the project.

---

### [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) üìã **WORK QUEUE**
Current priorities and future enhancements:
- **Priority 1:** Comprehensive E2E Testing (~220 tests needed)
- **Priority 2:** Documentation updates (README, CONTRIBUTING, migration guide)
- **Future:** Performance optimization, developer experience improvements

**Read this** to find tasks to work on.

---

### [E2E_TEST_PLAN.md](./E2E_TEST_PLAN.md) üß™ **TEST SPECIFICATIONS**
Detailed test plan for all 20 MCP tools:
- Test categories (CRUD, relations, search, temporal, validation, scenarios)
- Expected test count (~220 total)
- Test file structure
- Success criteria

**Reference this** when implementing E2E tests.

## üéØ Quick Start for New Contributors

1. **Understand the Project:**
   - Read [MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md](./MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md)
   - Review architecture: SQLite-only, `src/db/` directory, no abstractions

2. **Set Up Development:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo>
   cd devflow-mcp
   pnpm install
   pnpm test       # Should see 46 tests passing
   pnpm run dev    # Start server
   ```

3. **Pick a Task:**
   - See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for current priorities
   - Check [E2E_TEST_PLAN.md](./E2E_TEST_PLAN.md) for test work

4. **Start Contributing:**
   - Easy: Update root README.md (1-2 hours)
   - Medium: Implement E2E test suite (4-6 hours)
   - Advanced: Performance optimization (1-2 weeks)

## üìä Project Status

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| SQLite Migration | ‚úÖ Complete | Architecture simplified, Neo4j removed |
| Unit Tests | ‚úÖ Passing | 46/46 tests |
| E2E Tests | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Basic tests exist, comprehensive suite needed |
| Documentation | ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress | Core docs done, user docs needed |
| Production Ready | ‚úÖ Yes | Core functionality stable |

## üóÇÔ∏è Document History

### Removed Files (2025-10-17)
These files were removed as they're no longer relevant after migration completion:

- `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` (2,258 lines) - Step-by-step migration guide (completed)
- `E2E_TEST_SUMMARY.md` (220 lines) - Neo4j test results (outdated)
- `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` (544 lines) - Consolidated into MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md
- Old ROADMAP.md (1,148 lines) - Replaced with simplified version

**Total removed:** ~4,100 lines of outdated documentation

**Rationale:** These files served their purpose during the migration but are now obsolete. All relevant information has been consolidated into current docs.

## üìù Documentation Maintenance

### When to Update

| Document | Update Trigger |
|----------|---------------|
| MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md | Never (historical record) |
| ROADMAP.md | When priorities change or tasks complete |
| E2E_TEST_PLAN.md | When adding new tools or test categories |
| README.md (this file) | When doc structure changes |

### Document Purpose

```
MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md   ‚Üí  Historical record of what was done
ROADMAP.md             ‚Üí  Current priorities and task queue
E2E_TEST_PLAN.md       ‚Üí  Test specifications and requirements
README.md              ‚Üí  Navigation and quick start guide
```

## üîó External Documentation

These root-level files also need updating:

- `../README.md` - Main project README (needs Neo4j removal)
- `../CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contributor guide (needs Docker removal)
- `../.env.example` - Environment variables (needs simplification)

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md#priority-2-documentation-updates-medium) for details.

## üí° Tips for Documentation

### Writing Guidelines

- **Be Clear:** Use simple language, avoid jargon
- **Be Concise:** Remove unnecessary words
- **Be Current:** Update docs when code changes
- **Be Helpful:** Include examples and code snippets
- **Be Organized:** Use headings, lists, and tables

### Markdown Best Practices

- Use `# Heading 1` for document title
- Use `## Heading 2` for major sections
- Use `###` for subsections (max 3 levels)
- Use code blocks with language tags: ```typescript
- Use tables for structured data
- Use checklists: `- [ ]` for tasks
- Use emojis sparingly for visual hierarchy

## üìû Getting Help

**Architecture Questions:**
- Check [MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md](./MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md) for SQLite architecture
- Look at `src/db/` for implementation details

**Test Questions:**
- Check [E2E_TEST_PLAN.md](./E2E_TEST_PLAN.md) for specifications
- Look at `src/tests/integration/e2e/` for examples

**Task Questions:**
