## üìÑ Documentation Files

### 1. [MIGRATION_STATUS.md](./MIGRATION_STATUS.md)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive status report of the Neo4j ‚Üí SQLite migration

**Contents:**
- Executive summary of migration progress (85% complete)
- Completed work (SQLite storage provider, vector search, temporal versioning)
- Neo4j dependencies analysis (~4,000 lines of code)
- Feature comparison matrix (Neo4j vs SQLite)
- Remaining work breakdown
- Risk assessment
- Success criteria

**When to read:** Want to understand current state of the migration

---

### 2. [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)
**Purpose:** Step-by-step implementation plan to complete the migration

**Contents:**
- **Phase 1:** Configuration Migration (make SQLite default)
  - Task-by-task code changes
  - File modifications with code examples
  - Validation checklists

- **Phase 2:** E2E Testing with SQLite (validate all 20 MCP tools)
  - Test file structure
  - Test cases for each tool category
  - Performance benchmarks

- **Phase 3:** Neo4j Code Removal (cleanup)
  - Files to delete (~4,500 lines)
  - Dependencies to remove

- **Phase 4:** Documentation Updates
  - README updates
  - Migration guide
  - Docs consolidation

**When to read:** Ready to execute the migration work

**Estimated timeline:** 2-3 days total

---

### 3. [E2E_TEST_PLAN.md](./E2E_TEST_PLAN.md)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive end-to-end testing strategy

**Contents:**
- All 20 MCP tools to test
- 7 test categories (Happy path, validation, edge cases, errors, scenarios, performance, integration)
- Test file structure
- Success criteria (90%+ code coverage, zero flaky tests)
- Prompt tests (4 prompts to validate)

**When to read:** Implementing E2E tests (Phase 2 of roadmap)

**Status:** Plan defined, SQLite tests not yet implemented

---

### 4. [E2E_TEST_SUMMARY.md](./E2E_TEST_SUMMARY.md)
**Purpose:** Results of E2E testing (when completed)

**Current status:** From Neo4j testing phase, needs to be updated for SQLite

**When to read:** After completing E2E tests to validate results

## üóÇÔ∏è Document History

### Removed Files (2025-10-16)
The following implementation plans and status reports were removed as they're no longer needed:

- `sqlite-temporal-implementation-plan.md` (51kb) - Already executed
- `sqlite-temporal-implementation-code-review.md` (11kb) - Review complete
- `sqlite-temporal-implementation-summary.md` (4.9kb) - Redundant with MIGRATION_STATUS.md
- `sqlite-temporal-final-status.md` (7.4kb) - Consolidated into MIGRATION_STATUS.md
- `sqlite-vector-implementation-plan.md` (54kb) - Already executed
- `sqlite-vector-implementation-complete.md` (9.8kb) - Redundant with MIGRATION_STATUS.md
- `sqlite-vector-testing-blockers.md` (36kb) - Issues resolved
- `sqlite-vector-testing-fix-implementation-plan.md` (31kb) - Already executed

**Total space saved:** ~210kb of redundant documentation

**Rationale:** These files served their purpose during implementation but are now outdated. All relevant information has been consolidated into MIGRATION_STATUS.md and ROADMAP.md.

## üîÑ Documentation Maintenance

### When to Update

| Document | Update Trigger | Owner |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| MIGRATION_STATUS.md | After completing any migration phase | Dev Team |
| ROADMAP.md | When timeline or approach changes | Dev Team |
| E2E_TEST_PLAN.md | When adding new MCP tools or test categories | QA/Dev Team |
| E2E_TEST_SUMMARY.md | After running E2E test suite | QA Team |

### Document Lifecycle

```
Planning Phase:
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Create ROADMAP.md with implementation plan

Implementation Phase:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Update MIGRATION_STATUS.md as work progresses
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Reference ROADMAP.md for task details

Testing Phase:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Use E2E_TEST_PLAN.md as test specification
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Document results in E2E_TEST_SUMMARY.md

Completion:
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Archive old docs, update README.md
```
