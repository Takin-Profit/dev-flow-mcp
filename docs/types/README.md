## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) compliance implementation and type safety improvements for DevFlow MCP. This was a critical refactoring to ensure the server returns responses that match the official MCP specification.

## What Was Done

We implemented full MCP protocol compliance by:
1. Updating response types to include `isError` and `structuredContent` fields
2. Simplifying response builders to match MCP specification
3. Updating error handling to use simple string messages instead of complex objects
4. Refactoring all 17+ tool handlers to use the new response format
5. Adding comprehensive output schemas for type safety

## Next Steps

After code review approval, proceed with:
- Phase 3: Replace Error throws with error classes in business logic
- Phase 4: Update business logic method signatures to use branded types
- Phase 5: Create test builders and update E2E tests
