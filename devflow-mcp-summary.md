# DevFlow MCP Development Summary

This document summarizes the development work done, the tests added, and the remaining tasks to complete the integration testing phase.

## Completed Tasks

1.  **Fixed Neo4j Data Type Conversion Bugs**
    *   Identified that the Neo4j driver returns special data types (e.g., `Integer`, `DateTime`) that are not directly compatible with standard JSON serialization.
    *   Implemented a `convertNeo4jProperties` utility function in both `neo4j-storage-provider.ts` and `neo4j-vector-store.ts` to recursively convert these special types to native JavaScript types.
    *   Corrected the TypeScript errors related to the `toStandardDate` method by handling different temporal types appropriately.

2.  **Fixed Initial Integration Test Failures**
    *   Resolved the `Integer` comparison failure in the vector store tests by modifying the test to correctly handle the Neo4j `Integer` type.
    *   Addressed the root cause of the vector search tests failing, which was that the vector index was not `ONLINE` when the tests were being run.
    *   Implemented a `waitForVectorIndex` method in the `Neo4jSchemaManager` to poll and wait for the index to be ready before executing tests.
    *   Fixed the test data for the similarity threshold test to be more reliable.

3.  **Added New End-to-End Tests**
    *   Installed the `mcp-test-client` library to facilitate client-side testing of the MCP server.
    *   Created a new integration test file: `src/tests/integration/mcp-client.integration.test.ts`.
    *   Added e2e tests for listing tools, creating entities and relations, reading the graph, and performing semantic searches.
    *   Fixed all TypeScript errors in the new test file.

## Pending Tasks

1.  **Fix the E2E Test Runner Script**
    *   A new script, `scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh`, was created to run the new end-to-end tests.
    *   This script is responsible for starting the Neo4j container, starting the MCP server, running the tests, and cleaning up.
    *   The script currently has a bash syntax error that needs to be resolved.

2.  **Successfully Run E2E Tests**
    *   Once the `run-e2e-tests.sh` script is fixed, the `pnpm run test:e2e` command should be executed to run the new tests and verify that they pass.
